Flutter Animate
A performant library that makes it simple to add almost any kind of animated effect in Flutter.

Pre-built effects, like fade, scale, slide, flip, blur, shake, shimmer, shadows, crossfades, follow path, and color effects (saturation, color, and tint)
Easy custom effects and simplified animated builders
Synchronize animations to scroll, notifiers, or anything
Integrated events
All via a simple, unified API without fussing with AnimationController and StatefulWidget.
